# Fuzz Pillow

Fuzz Pillow is a sleepytime noisemaker supporting brown, white, and pink noise. I played with "harp music" but the result it truly horrendous.

I have some unnecessary parameters and sloppiness here and there because of some refactoring where I stopped in the middle because I didn't want to spend a lot of time on this. Several obvious improvements could be made.

I believe portaudio has some dependencies for building, but I might have lost the history on what I installed. Try installing libportaudio2 and pkg-config perhaps.

There probably isn't enough here to justify supporting anyone with issues--particularly because I am not a subject matter expert on the noise types, sound in general, etc.
